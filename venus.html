<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun</p>.
<p> It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</p> 
<p> As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight</p>
<p> Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn.</p>
<p> Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.</p><p> It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days.</p>
