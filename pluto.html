<p>Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>
<p> It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered.</p>
<p> After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun</p>
<p>. Beginning in the 1990s, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, including the dwarf planet Eris.</p>
<p> This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to formally define the term "planet"â€”excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf planet.</p>.
