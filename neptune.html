<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known Solar planet from the Sun.</p>
<p> In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.</p>
<p> It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.</p>
<p> Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere</p>
<p>. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU </p>
<p>. It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.
