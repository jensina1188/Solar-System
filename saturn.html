<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.</p>
<p> It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.</p>
<p>It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.</p>
<p> Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol  represents the god's sickle.</p>
<p> The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs no later than the 2nd century for the planet Saturn.</p>
